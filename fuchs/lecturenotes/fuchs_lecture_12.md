#### Maintenance in IoT

##### What is predictive maintenance?

Manual maintenance of machines is obsolete. Data of the machines/devices is fetched and analyzed in the cloud or the edge. If defined values exceed or undercut a certain threshold, a notification is sent, that maintenance is required.

##### What problem(s) does it solve?

* Makes manual maintenance in fixed intervals obsolete
* Reduce down-time
* Therefore, saves time checking each and every machine
* Quickly detecting defect machines and devices rather than searching for it

##### How is it related to the IoT?

* A lot of sensors are used, so that's the classic example for an IoT application. Data can then be analyzed in the cloud or the edge.
* It's the core component for industry 4.0

##### Give 3 examples of predictive maintenance in the IoT.

* Monitoring the health of spindles in milling machines
* Volvo identifies cracking and spalling of rotating equipment, gearing and motor defects
* Paper manufacturing companies monitor the state of paper-making machines with temperature and vibration sensors

##### Which role does data analytics play?

It is the central component, as the need for maintenance can mainly be detected through analyzing.

# Heartbeat Monitoring of Network Nodes

### How does a heartbeat monitor in a network work?

* In computer clusters, heartbeat network is a private network which is shared only by the cluster nodes, and is not accessible from outside the cluster. 
* It is used by cluster nodes in order to monitor each node's status and communicate with each other.
* The heartbeat method uses the FIFO nature of the signals sent across the network. By making sure that all messages have been received, the system ensures that events can be properly ordered.
* Heartbeat monitoring is an IBM® i cluster base function that ensures that each node is active by sending a signal from every node in the cluster to every other node in the cluster to convey that they are still active.

### What can it be used for?

* Watchdog Timer
* 

### Discuss in groups of 4-5 (5min)
– What can be secured in an IoT system with this type of monitoring?
– What feature in ulnoiot already supports heartbeats?
– Is this predictive maintenance (or what would need to be added)?

# Connect to/from Outside

* Port forwarding
  * Port 443
* Dynamic dns
* Port reflections

# Stand-Up Meeting

Stand-up:
– 10min max
– Everybody stands up, will not lean on anything, or use their phones
– Scrum master appoints a person who writes log (this person may sit)
– Reports (clock-wise) on their work related to the project
  * Last task you have done
  * Next task you will do (and how long you think this one will take)
  * Any things stopping you from being productive?
– Head to labs...

### Nymea

* What is their relation to IoT (2 impacted domains)
  * nymea is an industrial-level operating system for connected things; The IoT operating system for connected things
  * In addition, every product built on nymea comprises state-of-the-art security
  * nymea:cloud; nymea:ux
  * You can connect your hardware to an endless number of other products without any restrictions.
  * You can control M2M (machine to machine) connections easily and intuitively.
* What is their history?
  * In 2012 Bernhard and Simon were doing an exchange semester in South Korea. On their flight back home, they both were inspired by the technological advancements in the country and came up with a smart home device. The idea of "tune", a smart home hardware device and nymea, a revolutionary IoT software were born. Shortly after, Lukas and Simon joined the company as co-founders and software developers. After 3 years of intense development and improvement of the business model, guh GmbH was incorporated in the beginning of 2016. The focus of the company shifted from a hardware product, toward to a pure B2B focused IoT operating system - nymea. The software was a breakthrough success and the company was instantly profitable. As of today the company is still majority founder owned.
* Are they successful in the IoT, why or why not?
  * Mit seinem Internet-Of-Things-Betriebssystem nymea hat das Wiener Start-Up guh einen weiteren großen Schritt gemacht und eine siebenstellige Millionensumme eingesammelt. Mit seiner Software positioniert sich das junge Unternehmen gegenüber Branchengrößen wie Google, Apple und Amazon.
  * guh GmbH is a aPaaS (application Platform as a Service) company in the IoT industry based in Vienna/Austria.
  * Founded in 2016 the company was instantly profi table and still retains a lean shareholder structure with 86% of shares being held by the founders.
  * Successfully closed EUR 1 million seed funding round in 2017
