# External Speakers – Preparation

In time until then, google (and check LinkedIn)
– Flavia Andrade, Idea Lunchbox
  * Idea Lunchbox started as a Creative Agency but evolved into an International Accelerator. The creativity of primary students inspired the name. A child’s creativity is the highest of them all and during recess, the one that has the best “lunch” is the king/queen of recess with the highest power of trade. That’s how we see ourselves, as queens and kings of recess, with the highest creativity of all. We are a startup helping other startups and professionals succeed. 
  * Our mission and vision: “To bridge, strengthen, and expand global entrepreneurship and collaboration.”
