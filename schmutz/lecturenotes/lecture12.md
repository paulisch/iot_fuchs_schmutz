#### Maintenance in IoT

##### What is predictive maintenance?

Manual maintenance of machines is obsolete. Data of the machines/devices is fetched and analyzed in the cloud or the edge. If defined values exceed or undercut a certain threshold, a notification is sent, that maintenance is required.

##### What problem(s) does it solve?

* Makes manual maintenance in fixed intervals obsolete
* Reduce down-time

* Therefore, saves time checking each and every machine
* Quickly detecting defect machines and devices rather than searching for it

##### How is it related to the IoT?

* A lot of sensors are used, so that's the classic example for an IoT application. Data can then be analyzed in the cloud or the edge.
* It's the core component for industry 4.0

##### Give 3 examples of predictive maintenance in the IoT.

* Monitoring the health of spindles in milling machines
* Volvo identifies cracking and spalling of rotating equipment, gearing and motor defects
* Paper manufacturing companies monitor the state of paper-making machines with temperature and vibration sensors

##### Which role does data analytics play?

It is the central component, as the need for maintenance can mainly be detected through analyzing.

#### Heartbeat Monitoring of Network Nodes

##### How does a heartbeat monitor in a network work?

It is used for monitoring health of each node in a network by making sure that all messages have been received. In this communications protocol every node sends back a message in a given interval, in effect confirming that it is alive and has a heartbeat.

##### What can it be used for?

Watchdog timer

Keepalive

First step for predictive maintenance --> watch all nodes sending status messages, when one fails --> it probably needs maintenance

#### IoT Success Stories

##### Loxone

* What is their relation to IoT (2 impacted domains)?
  * Loxone is a smart home solution
  * Home Automation
* What is their history?
  * started in 2008
  * wanted intelligent and convenient automation in their own homes
* Are they successful in the IoT, why or why not?

Why? => Were one of the first in Upper Austria

Key product: Loxone server (can speak to many types of systems)

1. Mobile Computing students
2. Sailing App
3. Idea for sport apps
4. 2015 sold to adidas

###### Are they successful in the IoT, why or why not?
* not really, they removed their wearables

##### Nymea

* What is their relation to IoT (2 impacted domains)
  * nymea is an industrial-level operating system for connected things; The IoT operating system for connected things
  * In addition, every product built on nymea comprises state-of-the-art security
  * nymea:cloud; nymea:ux
  * You can connect your hardware to an endless number of other products without any restrictions.
  * You can control M2M (machine to machine) connections easily and intuitively.
* What is their history?
  * In 2012 Bernhard and Simon were doing an exchange semester in South Korea. On their flight back home, they both were inspired by the technological advancements in the country and came up with a smart home device. The idea of "tune", a smart home hardware device and nymea, a revolutionary IoT software were born. Shortly after, Lukas and Simon joined the company as co-founders and software developers. After 3 years of intense development and improvement of the business model, guh GmbH was incorporated in the beginning of 2016. The focus of the company shifted from a hardware product, toward to a pure B2B focused IoT operating system - nymea. The software was a breakthrough success and the company was instantly profitable. As of today the company is still majority founder owned.
* Are they successful in the IoT, why or why not?
  * Mit seinem Internet-Of-Things-Betriebssystem nymea hat das Wiener Start-Up guh einen weiteren großen Schritt gemacht und eine siebenstellige Millionensumme eingesammelt. Mit seiner Software positioniert sich das junge Unternehmen gegenüber Branchengrößen wie Google, Apple und Amazon.
  * guh GmbH is a aPaaS (application Platform as a Service) company in the IoT industry based in Vienna/Austria.
  * Founded in 2016 the company was instantly profi table and still retains a lean shareholder structure with 86% of shares being held by the founders.
  * Successfully closed EUR 1 million seed funding round in 2017
