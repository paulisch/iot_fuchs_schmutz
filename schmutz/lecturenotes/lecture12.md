#### Maintenance in IoT

##### What is predictive maintenance?

Manual maintenance of machines is obsolete. Data of the machines/devices is fetched and analyzed in the cloud or the edge. If defined values exceed or undercut a certain threshold, a notification is sent, that maintenance is required.

##### What problem(s) does it solve?

* Makes manual maintenance in fixed intervals obsolete
* Reduce down-time

* Therefore, saves time checking each and every machine
* Quickly detecting defect machines and devices rather than searching for it

##### How is it related to the IoT?

* A lot of sensors are used, so that's the classic example for an IoT application. Data can then be analyzed in the cloud or the edge.
* It's the core component for industry 4.0

##### Give 3 examples of predictive maintenance in the IoT.

* Monitoring the health of spindles in milling machines
* Volvo identifies cracking and spalling of rotating equipment, gearing and motor defects
* Paper manufacturing companies monitor the state of paper-making machines with temperature and vibration sensors

##### Which role does data analytics play?

It is the central component, as the need for maintenance can mainly be detected through analyzing.

#### Heartbeat Monitoring of Network Nodes

##### How does a heartbeat monitor in a network work?

It is used for monitoring health of each node in a network by making sure that all messages have been received. In this communications protocol every node sends back a message in a given interval, in effect confirming that it is alive and has a heartbeat.

##### What can it be used for?

Watchdog timer

Keepalive

First step for predictive maintenance --> watch all nodes sending status messages, when one fails --> it probably needs maintenance

#### IoT Success Stories

##### Loxone

* What is their relation to IoT (2 impacted domains)?
  * Loxone is a smart home solution
  * Home Automation
* What is their history?
  * started in 2008
  * wanted intelligent and convenient automation in their own homes
* Are they successful in the IoT, why or why not?

Why? => Were one of the first in Upper Austria

Key product: Loxone server (can speak to many types of systems)

##### Runtastic
###### What is their relation to IoT (2 impacted domains)
* fitness
* wearables
###### What is their history?
1. Mobile Computing students
2. Sailing App
3. Idea for sport apps
4. 2015 sold to adidas

###### Are they successful in the IoT, why or why not?
* not really, they removed their wearables
