# Lecture #01

## What type of programming experience?
HTL: Java, C#, Praktika
FH: Java, C(++), JS, Assembler, Bash

## What have you done with micro controllers? (Like Arduino, ESP8266, Particle/Photon)
Digilent(?): clock
MSP432: Temperature sensor, accelerometer, LEDs, "Radcomputer"

## Single board computers (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Beaglebone)?
-

## Who is a maker or part of a maker community?
-

## What do you already know about IoT?
Nothing I guess; Internet is great and tremendous

## What are your expectations from this class?
Good content, no stress

## What does the Internet of Things entail?
IoT means connecting physical devices, vehicles and other electronic items which enables these things to connect, collect and exchange data.

## Use laptop to google about IoT, find and note down including small description (submit as participation proof at end of class):
### – 3 domains (included areas)
Health care
Crypto currency, block chain
Smart homes

### – 2 commonly used (data) protocols
#### Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
Protocol for constrained devices; designed to be used between devices on the same constrained network, joined on the Internet; especially designed for IoT systems based on HTTP protocols.
#### MQTT Protocol (Message Queue Telemetry Transport)
a messaging protocol; three main components: subscriber, publisher and broker; The publisher generates the data and transmits the information to subscribers through the broker. The broker ensures security by cross-checking the authorisation of publishers and subscribers; preferred option for IoT based devices

### – 2 typical devices (appliance or controller)
Smart Door Locks
Crock-Pot Wemo Smart Wifi Slow Cooker: controlling crock-pot via smartphone

## Extend your domain and appliance/devices list, by 2 you didn’t have yet
### More domains:
Logistics and transport
Warehouse management

### More devices:
Robots (toys)
Wearables
3D printers
Heart rate measurement

## What are the benefits of IoT? (record at least 4)
You can communicate with your family
Bring connectivity to devices that never had connectivity before
One sulution with one interface can satisfy a number of use cases by providing building blocks => data can be shared easily
monitoring production robots can give information about when the robot has to be maintainanced or will go down to save costs and avoid the production to be down for a period of time

## What are the challenges? (record at least 4)
It is highly complex, slows down adaption
Connectivity does not find acceptance in the global market
The IOT is defined, but in fact it is not defined => There is no "one standard"
Very slow to deploy healthcare management solutions
IOT devices often are not secure! For example: cars, airplanes => very risky (Internet of broken things); for example hacking can be a risk for insecure solutions
Higher data rate means higher energy consumptions which is a disadvantage for battery life of IOT devices
Lag times can have significant consequences for workers in the industrial sector (for example being injured by supplying data too slow)
There is so much data, you can't take all of it to the cloud
