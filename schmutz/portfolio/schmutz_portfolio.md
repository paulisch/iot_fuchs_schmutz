#### Introduction
Today was the first day of the new course Internet Of Things (IOT). I was already looking forward for a new subject after weeks of Secure Mobile Systems (SMS). Also, I was curious about what the contents of IOT will be.

#### Lecture #01
At first, I was very confused about the structure of the lecture. Different from the rest of our courses all resources were located in places other than moodle. Secondly, the syllabus was quite unusual - especially some grading factors:
* lecture records
* portfolio

I have to admit, I was very unhappy in the first lecture, confused and I didn't know what creating a portfolio means. In my opinion, one could structure the explanation of what the exact tasks for us students consists of more clearer.
An exhilarating fact however was, that there is no exam. So after some minutes of thinking (and asking questions to you) I realized that the system is actually pretty good, but just a bit new to me.
I myself am not a designer, however I think slides could need some fancy improvements overall, but I am good with simple structured and non-overly-colorful resources.
Also, I have to mention, that (altough it was confusing and hard to understand at first) you are friendly, speak clearly and are ready to help anytime, which is important for me.
Furthermore, it is a good idea to keep the students awake during lecture with some questions to work on. I found the first lecture's content about IOT interesting. Besides the questions, I found it especially interesting, what the video showed about IOT and what dimension to expect from IOT.
To sum it up, I was quite overwhelmed in the first place, however as things got clearer to me, I now like the concept of the course.

#### Exercise #01
##### Lab Outline
* Setup raspberry pi iot gateway based on ulnoiot image
* [Setup key and ssh into it]
* Learn to blink on ESP8266 with Arduino IDE
* Login to wifi of pi from ESP8266
* Trigger blink remotely.
* Work in pairs.
* Document everything also (especially) failures â†’ in portfolio git folder
* Optional: make button work remotely (on second ESP8266), explore platformio

I work together with Boris Fuchs. As he already has experience with Raspberry Pi, he worked on setting up the Raspberry with the provided image.
While Boris was working on the Raspberry my task was to deal with the ESP8266. Quickly Boris and me found all necessary components to program and connect.
Setting up the Arduino IDE was quite easy. I 've never worked with it before. To work with the ESP8266 you have to do some extra steps to get the program to the ESP - downloading the right configuration (see exercise notes). It took me a while to select the right board (which was LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & mini). As there are example programs (and google/stackoverflow) after the I quickly found out how to write a LED blinking program (see [here](https://github.com/paulisch/iot_fuchs_schmutz/blob/master/exercises/ex01/esp8266_blink_led/esp8266_blink_led.ino)).
Also, by combining an internet source with a WiFi example in Arduino IDE I completed setting up a web page with buttons to turn on/off the LED in a few minutes. A tricky part was to find out the IP address of the ESP. That was in fact clear afterwards, as it was included in the example - to print it out to the Serial printer and show it with the Arduino Serial monitor. You can find the LED webserver program [here](https://github.com/paulisch/iot_fuchs_schmutz/blob/master/exercises/ex01/esp8266_wifi_led/esp8266_wifi_led.ino).
